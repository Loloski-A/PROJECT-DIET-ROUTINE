**DIET ROUTINE**

Maintaining a balanced diet is crucial for leading a healthy life, but it can be challenging to know what to eat and in what quantity.
With the increasing prevalence of health issues like obesity, diabetes, and heart diseases, it has become even more crucial to ensure a balanced diet. 
To address this issue, we have designed a system that will help individuals determine the types of food they should eat to achieve a balanced diet based on their health status.
The system utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms that analyze an individual's health symptoms and provide personalized dietary recommendations.
By taking into account an individual's medical history, current health status, and dietary preferences, the system generates a tailored meal plan that ensures optimal nutrient intake.
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and accessible tool that can help individuals make informed decisions about their diet and health. 
Our system offers a comprehensive solution that takes into account a range of factors that contribute to a healthy diet. 
We believe that this system has the potential to revolutionize the way individuals approach their dietary habits and improve their overall health and well-being.
In this report, we will provide an overview of the system's design and implementation, including the data sources, algorithms, and user interface.
We will also discuss the results of our pilot study and the future directions for the system.
Overall, we hope that this project will contribute to improving the health outcomes of individuals and promote a healthier society.
